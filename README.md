#Replace the placeholder text with your own dot emails in the 'inter.py' file. Add 15 dot emails from one Gmail account and another 15 from a different Gmail account. To create dot emails, enter your Gmail address and press the 'Generate' button

Replace the movie URL on line 44 with the one from the location you selected in BookMyShow.
After copying the URL for the movie you want to add to your automatic interests, select the lines below and press 'Ctrl+H'. It will prompt you to replace the selected text, paste the copied URL and click on 'Replace All'. After replacing the email and URL, the entire process will be automated. You only need to enter the OTP within 18 seconds (use your mobile phone for faster entry of OTP).

To run the program, download the latest version of Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and extract the file to a specific folder.
Open the command prompt in that folder and enter 'inter' or double-click on 'inter.py'. Alternatively, you can rename the file and run it."

## "If you know how to automate OTP entry, then fork it."
