## I searched on Google but couldn't find it, so I created it. That's it.

Replace the placeholder text with your own dot emails in the 'im.py' file. 

(Add 15 dot emails from one Gmail account and another 15 from a different Gmail account. To create dot emails, enter your Gmail address and press the 'Generate' button.)

## Replace the movie URL on line 51 with the one from the location you selected in BookMyShow and do same in below code also where url asked...

 ## the entire process will be automated. You only need to enter the OTP within 18 seconds (use your mobile phone for faster entry of OTP).

To run the program, download the latest version of Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and extract the file to a specific folder.

# 👉 Note:Every time Bms updates the code, it varies. So, fork the code if not work means...

Open the command prompt in that folder and

## enter in cmd undetected_chromedriver

## enter im.py. Alternatively, you can rename the file and run it."

👉Note:-

👉If you have the latest version of Selenium, the code may not run

👉open cmd and enter 

pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"

## "If you know how to automate OTP entry, then fork it."
